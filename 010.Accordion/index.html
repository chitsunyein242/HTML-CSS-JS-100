                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML (for content and structure) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

                    JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic programming language primarily used to add interactivity and complex features to web pages.

                    Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is not a framework, library, or programming language itself, but rather an environment that enables the use of JavaScript for server-side and network applications.
